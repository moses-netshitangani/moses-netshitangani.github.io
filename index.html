        <p>This is the landing page for our project. We have compiled a conclusive report
            about some of the best DevOps dashboards available, and also gave a recommendation
            about which dashboard Allan Gray should consider using.
        </p>
        <p>We also built a Proof of Concept for the Grafana dashboard, as we saw that 
            Hygieia was just too complicated to install.
